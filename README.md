## Instalation  (._.)>

    The following lists all necessary packages, nodules, and cdns required for the project to run effectively.

> - Inquirer
> - Node.js
> - NPM (Node Package Manager)
> - A Linux Bash Command Line


## /_ Usage _\

  To use the Application, you first need to download the code off the repo. Then install all of the necessary packages, using the command  "npm i"   . After it's ready to go, then simply enter the command:  "node index.js"    to start the application.
  Once started, it will prompt you straight away, on the command line, for answers to a series of questions. The last question involving a picture, it will ask if you have the URL to the pic you want to use for the project's screenshot. For the sake of brevity, I added a random pic to simply demonstrate how that might be done. I didn't feel the need to add an actual pic of the API, because the video showed you the jist of it mostly. How it worked etc..
